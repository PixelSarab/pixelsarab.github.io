<p>I have worked in a multinational corporation, so that implies that we worked cross time-zones, which was challenging. I started there as Production Designer, which consisted in localising assets. I took every new project opportunity, proving my versatility within the organization, which consisted on needs at the time with no individual to work on it, they were mostly in-house softwares which I need to learn and be profiscient at quickly, I pride myself on being a fast learner.<br>I helped with IT technicalities as well, which ranges from hardware setup to script development and software setup. I also led in engagement activities, like paper airplane origami challenge and miscelaneous games. In the end I opened the market for retouching on site, and finally expaned my team..<br>As a senior my responsibilities were in leadership, project management, and doing design work, which was mostly retouching. Even though I was a retoucher, I implemented development as often as I can. That meant scripting photoshop to automate the tedious export process, and a tool that fetches data from a database and creats photoshop documents based on the fetched data.<br>Also in cimpress there were a training for first aid which I took.</p>
